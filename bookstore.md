# Bookstore Checkout System
## Actor involved in the design of a checkout system :
### 1. Customers :
Customers are the primary users of the checkout system. They need to be able to easily and efficiently pay for their purchases and leave the store in a timely manner.
### 2. Cashier : 
Cashiers operate the checkout system and are responsible for scanning items, taking payment, and providing customer service. They need to be trained on how to use the system and have a thorough understanding of the store's policies and procedures.
### 3. Store Managers :
Store managers are responsible for the overall operation of the store and for making sure that the checkout system is running smoothly. They need to be able to access reports and data from the system to track sales and inventory levels.

## Use case scenarios :
### 1. Purchase items :
Customers purchase items from the store and pay for them using cash, credit card, or other forms of payment.
### 2. Return  or exchange items :
Customers return or exchange items that they have purchased, following the store's return and exchange policy.
